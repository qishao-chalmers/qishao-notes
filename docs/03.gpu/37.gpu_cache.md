## 1. [22] Adaptive Memory-Side Last-Level GPU Caching

- Private LLCs, which replicate shared data across multiple slices, provide higher bandwidth but suffer from higher miss rates.
- Shared LLCs avoid redundancy, reducing miss rates, but suffer bandwidth contention under high sharing.

In the shared LLC organization, an LLC slice is shared by all SMs.

The LLC slice for a given cache line is determined by a few address bits.

Collectively, all LLC slices associated with a given memory controller cache the entire memory address space served by the memory controller.

In the private LLC organization, an LLC slice is private to a cluster of SMs.

An LLC slice caches the entire memory partition served by the respective memory controller for only a single cluster of SMs.

The LLC slice for a cache line is thus determined by the cluster ID.

### Dynamic Reconfiguration Rules

- Switch to private if:
  - Miss rate remains comparable (within 2%)
  - Bandwidth gain outweighs miss rate penalty
- Revert to shared:
  - At new kernel or time epoch
