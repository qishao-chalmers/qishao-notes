## Attention
### 1. Transformers are RNNs:Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention :+1: :+1:
### 2. Efficient Attention: Attention With Linear Complexities

Also another paper:
Gaussian‑Linearized Transformer with Tranquilized Time‑Series Decomposition Methods for Fault Diagnosis and Forecasting of Methane Gas Sensor Arrays.

These two paper are almost the same.
Basic idea:
classic calculation of attention:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70208eed-9009-4677-a017-57a14773dfb8" width="40%">

Instead of calculating QK, it calculates KV.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a6ec80b-8119-47fc-8198-851803dcff6d" width="70%">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f81039ea-43fd-43c5-a5d7-6b9787459a1b" width="70%">

Figure from: Gaussian‑Linearized Transformer

Class calculation complexity:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5902c7ec-ac3d-4bbd-92bb-fa95c82208f5" width="50%">

Provided the model dimension is << sequence length, 

compute complexity in linear attention:

[Figure Source](https://sandeshgh.com/post/transformers_rnn/)

Provided the model dimension is << sequence length, linear complexity is much lower compute complexity compared with classic attention.

Please notice that in  the KV result. The intermediate result is dmodel * dmodel, instead of N * N.
N is context length and dmodel is model dimension.

## Is All You Need
### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
Idea: factorizes Q, K, and V activations using contextual tensor-decompositions

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be3c6aaf-d33f-42d7-8f15-4b57a8fa9b15" width="70%">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c345baa-5481-43f8-9f07-9d88dd9f7644" width="70%">


Instead of caching Q,K,V, it could only cache A,B of Q and A,B of K.
This matrix factorization might be similar to LORA, using multiplication of two matrices A and B to represent Q.

By caching A,B, it reduces large memory required by KV cache.

### 28. [C10395 0221] GPT Understands,Too
Straightforward Idea.\
Changing a single word in the prompt might result in substantial performance drop.\
P-Tuning that employs trainable continuous prompt embeddings in concatenation with discrete prompts.\
Empirically, P-Tuning not only stabilizes training by minimizing the gap between various discrete prompts, but also improves performance by a sizeable margin on a wide range of NLU tasks including LAMA and SuperGLUE.\
P-Tuning is generally effective for both frozen and tuned language models, under both the fully-supervised and few-shot settings.

## Old Gold Time of Transformer
### 1. tansformer-xl
#### Segment-Level Recurrence Mechanism
- Extends context length by reusing hidden states (memory) across segments.
- Instead of processing fixed-length context windows independently, Transformer-XL introduces a **memory module**:
  - Memory at segment `t` is represented as:
    
  - This allows the model to attend to representations from previous segments.
- Enables modeling of long-term dependencies without recomputation of overlapping segments.
#### Relative Positional Encoding (RPE):
- Introduces position encodings relative to each query-key pair, improving generalization across sequence lengths.
- The positional bias is calculated as:

#### Segment-Level Attention:
- The attention mechanism incorporates both the current segment and memory from previous segments:
